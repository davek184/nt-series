Changes from original nt-980
* Bottom row alternate layouts
* Stepped caps lock support
* Rotated numpad plus and enter keys
* Added alternate LED location under numlock key
* Added reset pin next to the right spacebar stab (to go into bootloader mode)
* Added second JST connector (JST 2.0 5 pin)
* Labeling on front and back (trying something)

It does work with the stock plate but only for the original layout.  Other layouts would require modding the plate or getting a new one.

NOTE: 
* **The JST connector uses a different PIN arrangement then the original Leopold daughter/middle board pay attention to the cable used if going for this connection method!**
* I didn't update the Schematic for the changes I made because I have no idea on how to do that and everytime I tried it caused more problems
