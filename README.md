Replacement PCBs for the FC660m, FC750r and FC980m.

Each of these PCBs have been tested by me, but I cannot guarantee that they work for you.

Use the latest nightly version of KiCAD to open these files. Gerbers and BOM are included for every PCB.

## Stabilizers
All of these PCB designs support PCB mounted stabilizers, but only with a custom made plate, as the stock plate tabs prevent you from putting the plate and PCB together with PCB mounted stabilizers installed.
