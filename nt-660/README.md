# nt-660 PCB

Forked from Evyd13 with changes listed below with the goal to fit in the Norbauer heavy-6 case.  Thought none of the changes made will affect fitting in a standard fc660m usb-mini case.

(Do not forget the daughterboard in the subdirectory)

# Changes
- Added JST Connector for USB
- Added JST connector for RGB
- Added MegaMan logo
- Removed ISO enter (can be added back if you copy the footprint from evyd13's version and check the traces)

# Note: 
DO NOT populate the mini-usb connector if planning to use in Norbauer heavy-6 case!
