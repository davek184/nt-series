Changes from original nt-980
* Bottom row alternate layouts
* Stepped caps lock support
* Rotated numpad plus and enter keys
* Added alternate LED location under numlock key
* Added reset pin next to the right spacebar stab (to go into bootloader mode)
* Added daughterboard connector (QWIIC/JST SH) - Standard Universal Daughterboard pinnout
* RGB Underglow connector (QWIIC/JST SH)
* Labeling on front and back

It does work with the stock plate but only for the original layout.  Other layouts would require modding the plate or getting a new one.  Plate files can be found https://github.com/davek184/nt-series/tree/main/nt-980/plate
