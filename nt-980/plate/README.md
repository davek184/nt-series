Plate files for FC980m.  

**This CANNOT be used with the stock FC980m PCB!** (Stock PCB uses plate stabs)

The KLE files can be used with the Ai03 plate generator to get the proper cut out possition of the switches (the edge cuts would need to be manually added to the file): https://kbplate.ai03.com/

Note: Only confirmed Alternate ANSI Layout <alternateLayouts.ANSI.dxf>, the other layout files "should" work but use at your own risk.
