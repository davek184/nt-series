Replacement USB-Mini daughterboard for FC980m/c can be used with the stock case or Norbauer Heavy-9.

## BOM

| LCSC part # | Description   | Value | Package  | Amount |
| ----------- | ------------- | ----- | -------- | ------:|
| C145778     | Capacitor     |       | SMD/TH   | 1      |
| C160404     | Connector     |       | SMD      | 1      |

## Cable

This daughterboard uses a different connector then the OEM one. Suggest starting with an [Adafruit 4424 cable](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4424) so no crimping needs to be done. *Prefer to repin when possible so all my cables use the same colors because flipping 5v can do bad bad things.* 

**(Color code: Black: Ground, Yellow: D+, Blue: D-, Red: 5v)**
