## Cable

This daughterboard uses a different connector then the OEM one. Suggest starting with an [Adafruit 4424 cable](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4424) so no crimping needs to be done. *Prefer to repin when possible so all my cables use the same colors because flipping 5v can do bad bad things.*
