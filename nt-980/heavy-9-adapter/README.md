The Norbauer Heavy-9 can't support flexible plates with out an adaper to transfer the connecting load from the plate to the back of the PCB. 
(Would crack the plate by using the standard mounting system.)

Need:
* 4x Side adapters
* 1x Center adapter 
* 5x Screws: M4-0.7 x 16mm

I printed in ABS with 100% fill via TreatStock.com

The USB plate adapter is ment to work with the universal daughterboard project.  It is okay its slightly too tall.  Should be about 1 ~ 2mm shorter.  Also after getting the daugherboard in the right spot (left to right).  I notched the ends so 2 screws could be put in so it was solid.  I should have ordered metal screws instead of plastic ones. Something I will replace next time I have a chance.

Use at your own risk!
