The Norbauer Heavy-9 can't support flexible plates with out an adaper to transfer the connecting load from the plate to the back of the PCB. 
(Would crack the plate by using the standard mounting system.)

Need:
* 4x Heavy-9 Adapter
* 1x Heavy-9 Center adapter 
* 5x Screws: M4-0.7 x 16mm

I printed in ABS with 100% fill via TreatStock.com

The USB plate adapter is ment to work with the universal daughterboard project.  It works okay but could use a little more refinement.  i have sent out for v5 to be made which slightly tweaks the depth. 

Use at your own risk!
