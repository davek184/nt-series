The Norbauer Heavy-9 can't support flexible plates with out an adaper to transfer the connecting load from the plate to the back of the PCB. 
(Would crack the plate by using the standard mounting system.)

Need:
* 4x Heavy-9 Adapter
* 1x Heavy-9 Center adapter 
* 5x Screws: M4-0.7 x 16mm

I printed in ABS with 100% fill via TreatStock.com

USB plate adapter
* For using a universal daughterboard
* Requires 2x or 4x m2 6mm screws and nuts to secure the daughterboard to the brackets
* Requires foam about 2.5mm thick to sit under the plate
* Washers: 2x to keeps the plate secure to the Heavy-9 backplate (size SAE #6 or M4)

Rubber padding is backing on mouse pad.  Stack of rubber pads I put under the spacebar so there is not too much flex.
